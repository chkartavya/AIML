Q11. Given a DataFrame 'df' with columns 'A' and 'B', 
how can you select rows where the value in column 'A' is greater than 10 and 
the value in column 'B' is less than 5?

a) df[(df['A'] > 10) & (df['B'] < 5)]
b) df.query('A > 10 and B < 5')
c) df.loc[(df['A'] > 10) & (df['B'] < 5)]

Q12. Calculate the median for the dataset: [15, 40, 30, 10, 50, 20]?

Q13. For a regression model, if the (MSE) is 25,what is the (RMSE)?  

Q14. Given a dataset with the values [8, 10, 12, 15, 20], 
calculate the interquartile range (IQR).


A = median of 8, 10
B = median of 12, 15, 20

IQR = (B - A)


Q15. In a classification problem, 
if a model correctly predicts 80 out of 100 instances, 
what is its accuracy?

Q16. A box contains 3 red balls and 5 green balls.
     A second box contains 4 red balls and 6 green balls. 
     If you randomly select one of the boxes and 
     then randomly select a ball from that box, 
     what is the probability of selecting a red ball?


    P(red ball)  = P(R/I)*P(I) + P(R/II)*P(II)

Q17. A matrix of [[2,5],[-1,0]] and vector [-2, 8], 
     find the transformation in vector also plot them?


Normal Gaussian : mean = 0

Standard Normal Gaussian : mean = 0 , variance = 1


Gaussian formula

N(X/u,variance) = (1/(2TTsigma**2))*e^(-(x - u)/2sigma**2)

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
